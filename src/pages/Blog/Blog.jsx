                <h3 className='text-2xl font-bold'>1. What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where should we store them on the client-side?</h3>
                <p className='pb-5'><span className='font-bold'>Answer: </span> An access token and a refresh token are commonly used in authentication systems to grant and manage access to protected resources.
                    Access Token:
                    An access token is a credential that is used to authenticate and authorize a client to access protected resources. It is typically a long string of characters.
                    When a user logs in or authenticates with a server, they are issued an access token that contains specific information about the user and their permissions.
                    The client includes the access token in each request to the server to access protected resources, such as making API calls.
                    The server validates the access token to ensure the client has the necessary permissions and then allows or denies access to the requested resources accordingly.
                    Access tokens usually have an expiration time to limit their validity. Once expired, the client needs to obtain a new access token to continue accessing protected resources.
                    Refresh Token:
                    A refresh token is a credential that is used to obtain a new access token when the current one expires.
                    Unlike access tokens, refresh tokens are typically long-lived and have a longer expiration time.
                    When an access token expires, the client can send the refresh token to a dedicated endpoint on the server to request a new access token without requiring the user to log in again.
                    The server verifies the refresh token's validity, and if it's valid, issues a new access token to the client.
                    Refresh tokens should be kept secure since they have a longer lifespan and can be used to obtain new access tokens.

                    Remember, security practices may vary depending on the specific requirements of your application or framework. It's recommended to consult relevant security guidelines and documentation when implementing token-based authentication.</p>

                <p className='pb-5'><span className='font-bold'>Answer: </span> SQL databases use a structured data model known as tables, rows, and columns. Data is organized in a predefined schema, and relationships between tables are established using primary and foreign keys.
                    NoSQL databases, on the other hand, employ various data models, including key-value, document, columnar, and graph. These models offer flexibility in storing unstructured and semi-structured data without requiring a fixed schema.

                    SQL databases use SQL as the standard query language for performing operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting data (CRUD operations). SQL provides a rich set of powerful declarative query capabilities, including joins, aggregations, and complex filtering.

                    NoSQL databases typically have their own query languages specific to their data model. For example, document-oriented databases use query languages like MongoDB's query language or Couchbase's N1QL, which resemble JSON-like syntax. Key-value stores often have simple key-based operations like get and put.
                    Use Cases:
                    SQL databases are well-suited for applications with structured data and complex relationships, such as transactional systems, e-commerce platforms, content management systems, and business applications that require strong consistency and complex querying.

                    NoSQL databases are often chosen for handling large-scale applications with rapidly changing data and high read/write workloads. They are commonly used in scenarios like real-time analytics, content caching, session management, social media feeds, IoT data, and scenarios where flexible schema and horizontal scalability are crucial.

                    The choice between SQL and NoSQL depends on your application's requirements, data characteristics, scalability needs, and development preferences.</p>

                <p className='pb-5'><span className='font-bold'>Answer: </span> Express.js and Nest.js are both popular web application frameworks used for building server-side applications with Node.js. While they serve similar purposes, they have different approaches and features.

                    Express.js:
                    Express.js is a minimalist web application framework for Node.js. It provides a simple and unopinionated approach to building web applications and APIs.
                    It offers a set of lightweight middleware functions and routing capabilities, making it easy to handle HTTP requests, define routes, and process data.
                    Express.js allows developers to create server-side applications quickly and efficiently, providing flexibility and freedom to choose additional libraries or components as needed.
                    It has a large and active community, making it easy to find resources, plugins, and middleware to extend its functionality.

                    Nest.js:
                    Nest.js is a progressive, opinionated framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications with Node.js. It takes inspiration from Angular and adopts several of its concepts and design patterns.
                    Nest.js provides a modular architecture based on modules, controllers, and services, promoting a separation of concerns and modularity in application development.
                    It integrates well with TypeScript, offering strong typing and enhanced developer experience.
                    Nest.js incorporates dependency injection, allowing for efficient testing, code reusability, and maintainability.
                    It provides built-in support for various features such as routing, middleware, authentication, and database integration, simplifying the development process and reducing boilerplate code.
                    Nest.js supports different transport layers like HTTP, WebSockets, gRPC, and more, making it suitable for building microservices or real-time applications.</p>

                <p className='pb-5'><span className='font-bold'>Answer: </span> MongoDB's aggregate is a powerful feature that allows you to perform advanced data processing and analysis on your MongoDB collections. It provides a flexible way to query and manipulate data using a pipeline of stages.
                    The aggregate operation takes an array of stages as input, where each stage defines a specific operation or transformation to be performed on the data. The stages are applied sequentially, and the output of one stage becomes the input for the next stage in the pipeline.Here's a high-level overview of the basic stages commonly used in an aggregate pipeline:

                    $match: Filters the documents based on specified criteria, similar to the find operation. It allows you to select documents that match certain conditions.
                    $project: Shapes the documents in the pipeline by specifying which fields to include or exclude. It can also create new computed fields and reshape the existing ones.
                    $group: Groups the documents by a specified key and performs aggregate functions like sum, average, count, etc., on the grouped data.
                    $sort: Sorts the documents based on one or more fields in ascending or descending order.
                    $limit and $skip: Restricts the number of documents returned (limit) or skips a specified number of documents (skip).
                    $lookup: Performs a left outer join with another collection, allowing you to combine documents from multiple collections based on a common field.
                    $unwind: Deconstructs an array field from the input documents, creating a separate document for each element in the array. Useful when you want to analyze or manipulate individual elements within an array.
                    These are just a few examples of the stages available in the aggregate pipeline. MongoDB provides many more stages and operators to handle complex data processing requirements.</p>
